### Patch Changes

- 4abc389: Close access-control holes in the server and in agent jobs.
  
  - Run ids `.` and `..` are refused. The router decodes `%2E%2E` before the id check ran, so `GET /api/runs/%2E%2E/files/sdods.db` returned the platform database to anyone with `artifacts:read`.
  - Run files, trees, comparisons, artifacts and HTML reports check the caller's workspace role for the run's project (from the database, a live job, or the run's `run.json`). `/reports/*` sat outside `/api/` and needed no session at all. Ingest refuses to write into a run, or file a manifest under a project, the caller cannot edit.
  - HTML, SVG and XML served from run directories carry `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` and `nosniff`, so an uploaded page runs with an opaque origin instead of the viewer's session. Uploaded `artifacts.tgz` archives can no longer write `html-report/`, which is served unsandboxed because the Playwright report needs `localStorage`.
  - The auth gate matches the routed path. `/%61pi/tokens` reached `/api/tokens` while skipping authentication and the CSRF check.
  - Sign-ins are throttled per username as well as per IP. `trustProxy` is now `SDODS_TRUST_PROXY` (default `false`); it was always on, so a forged `X-Forwarded-For` gave every guess a fresh address. The Cloud Run deploy sets it to `true`.
  - Agent job `plan` and `spec` must be regular files inside the project, outside dotfiles and hidden directories. They were read verbatim, so `spec: "/proc/self/environ"` streamed the server's environment back through the job log.
  - Agent CLIs (claude-code, codex) start the sdods MCP server without the `agents` capability and disallow `proposal_accept` / `proposal_reject`, so a job can no longer accept its own proposal. Claude Code is limited to the role's tools. Playwright's own MCP server is no longer attached by default, and the bridge used by the OpenAI-compatible and Ollama adapters drops `browser_run_code_unsafe`, `browser_run_code` and `browser_evaluate` from it.
  - `sdods config show` (plain, `--json`, `--explain`) masks header-auth values and credential-looking headers such as `X-Api-Key`; `--explain` reads from the same redacted tree instead of a weaker regex of its own.
