Stop publishing Playwright traces, and redact the ones a run keeps (#101).

A `trace.zip` records every request's `Cookie`/`Authorization` headers, `Set-Cookie` responses, the context's `storageState` (cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB — where Firebase keeps its refresh token) and typed values, so for projects with pool accounts it carries live sessions.

- **Integrations never upload, attach or link a trace.** GitHub issues no longer link `trace.zip` through `SDODS_PUBLIC_URL` or the CI artifacts page, and `uploadToRelease` no longer uploads it; Jira no longer attaches it. Both name the trace's local path under a warning that it contains credentials, with the `npx playwright show-trace` command. The video is still linked or uploaded (it shows the screen, not headers or storage).
- **`sdods run` redacts every trace after the run**, before ingest and integrations: `runner-output/**/trace.zip`, the HTML report's copies under `html-report/data/`, zips nested in blob shard reports, and the BASE64 trace bodies embedded in `messages.ndjson` (which ingest turns back into `trace.zip`). Credential headers (`Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `X-Api-Key` and similar), cookie values, localStorage/sessionStorage/IndexedDB values, `httpCredentials` passwords, password inputs in DOM snapshots and values typed into password/secret/token fields become `[redacted]`. Other entries are copied through unchanged and the trace viewer opens the result. Request/response bodies and page text are not redacted.
- New `evidence.redactTraces` (default `true`; env files may override it). `evidence.trace` and `sdods run --trace <mode>` already control whether traces are recorded at all.
- Docs warn that traces are credential-bearing (GitHub and Jira guide, `sdods trace`, `project.yaml` reference).
